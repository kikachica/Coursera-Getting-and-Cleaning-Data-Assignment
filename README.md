This repository contains the R code for tidying a data set provided in the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set and the resulting .txt files
containing the tidy data and the summarized data.
 
The source data is available from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and
the data set is available to download from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The code does the following:

merges test and training data into one big data set.
Adds activities and subjects into the merged data set and adds names to the variables
Creates a tidy data set and a summarised data set containing averages for each measurment for each subject and activity.
The code also writes .txt files for tidy data and summarised data.
